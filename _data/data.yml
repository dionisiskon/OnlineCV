    title: ABOUT ME
    summary: |
     I am a third-year Department of Informatics Undergraduate Student at Ionian University. I have developed basic skills in some programming languages that I learn throughout my semester and also by myself in my spare time.
     Another key point that I want to mention is that I am hardworking and try very hard to get the best result as I also happen to be a perfectionist. I am now looking to further develop my skills in my field and particularly in cybersecurity because it is an interesting subject that is extremely appealing to me.

        I enjoy University a great deal as there is always a new subject to study and get familiar with which is exciting.
        The subjects vary in term of hours that are needed to be able to understand the concept behind them and to successfully finish the assignments, which makes particular ones somewhat a challenge, but that challenge is always welcome!

        Throughout my education i have developed basic programming skills in:

        - Java and Javascript
        - Python 
        - C and C++
        - Phaser Game Engine(Html and JS)
        - CTF Challenges
